<p>Minnesota's 2014 college graduates left school with more than $31,000 in student debt on average, according to a just-released report by The Institute for College Access and Success. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.startribune.com/college-debt-still-climbing-for-graduates-says-project-on-student-debt/337503401/">That puts us fifth-highest in the nation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
